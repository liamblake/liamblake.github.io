My personal [website](https://liamblake.github.io/), built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a fork of the [Poole/Hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde) that I've ripped apart.

## Local setup

First, ensure that `ruby` is installed: <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/>.

Install the `jekyll` and `bundler` gems:
```sh
gem install jekyll bundler
```

Build the site
```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The site is available at <http://localhost:4000>.
