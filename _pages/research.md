I am currently a doctoral student at [the University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/), where I am developing techniques for estimation and inference in mathematical models with unresolved components. 
This work is supervised by [Associate Professor Sanjeeva Balasuriya](https://sanji-balasuriya.github.io/), [Dr. John Maclean](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/john.maclean), and [Dr. Andrew Black](https://andxblack.github.io/).

Prior to this, I completed a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) in Applied Mathematics at [the University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/), under the supervision of [Associate Professor Sanjeeva Balasuriya](https://sanji-balasuriya.github.io/) and [Dr. John Maclean](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/john.maclean).
My research looked at devising practical and computationally efficient methods for characterising uncertainty in geophysical systems, such as the ocean, atmosphere, and climate.
Uncertainty can arise from many sources, including measurement error and unresolved process, and directly accounting for this can improve the predictions and forecasts of these models. 
I combined stochastic processes, dynamical systems, and scientific computing (in [Julia](https://julialang.org/)) to understand how this uncertainty impacts predictions from a model, without having to resort to computationally expensive simulation.
My completed thesis is available [here](https://github.com/liamblake/mphil-thesis).
